        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Taken from Dakota Kelly: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/">See original on all recipes</a></p>
        <P>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</P>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3.5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>.25 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1.25 cups of milk</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
